            <!-- Post Body -->
            <div class="post-body">

                <p class="post-lede">You take a gym selfie in January. You take another one in June. You pull them both
                    up on your phone, pinch-zoom around, hold your thumb over one while you swipe to the other, and try
                    to answer one question: <em>did anything actually change?</em></p>
                <p>That's how most people compare progress photos. It's broken in at least six ways — and it's the
                    reason so many people quit when they were actually making progress.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>1. You couldn't tell if your body fat actually changed</h2>

                <p><strong>Before:</strong> You're staring at two photos taken six months apart. You think you look
                    leaner, but you're not sure. Lighting is different. You might just be more tan. There's no number,
                    no metric, no objective measurement — just vibes.</p>

                <p><strong>After:</strong> Open any two photos in GainFrame and you'll see an estimated body fat
                    percentage on each one — no scale, no calipers, no guessing. The compare view shows the exact delta
                    between them: "-3.2% body fat." You don't wonder if you got leaner. You <em>know</em>.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/before-after/compare.PNG"
                        alt="GainFrame compare view showing BF% on both photos with delta">
                </div>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>2. You didn't know your weight difference</h2>

                <p><strong>Before:</strong> Maybe you remember what you weighed in January. Maybe you don't. Even if you
                    do, you're trying to hold that number in your head while looking at photos on a completely different
                    screen. Weight and photos live in two separate worlds.</p>

                <p><strong>After:</strong> GainFrame pulls your weight from Apple Health and pins it to the photo from
                    that day. When you compare two photos, the weight difference is right there — overlaid on the
                    images. No mental math. No switching apps. You see exactly how much you gained or lost between any
                    two dates, in the same view as the visual proof.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>3. Your photos were different sizes and not aligned</h2>

                <p><strong>Before:</strong> One photo is a mirror selfie from four feet away. The other is a
                    front-facing camera shot at arm's length. Your body is a different size in each frame, positioned
                    differently, and slightly rotated. You're comparing two photos where the only thing that's
                    consistent is that you're in both of them.</p>

                <p>When you put them side by side, your shoulders don't line up. Your torso is higher in one photo than
                    the other. The visual comparison is useless because the framing is completely different.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal"
                    style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; align-items: stretch; justify-content: center;">
                    <img src="../assets/before-after/before.PNG" alt="Un-aligned raw before photo"
                        style="width: 48%; object-fit: cover;">
                    <img src="../assets/before-after/after.PNG" alt="Un-aligned raw after photo"
                        style="width: 48%; object-fit: cover;">
                </div>

                <p><strong>After:</strong> GainFrame auto-aligns your photos so your body is the same size, in the same
                    position, in both frames — regardless of how the originals were shot. It detects your shoulders,
                    torso, and hips, then scales and repositions each image to match.</p>

                <p>The result: the <em>only</em> thing that's different between the two photos is your actual physique.
                    That's what a real comparison looks like.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>4. You had no workout context</h2>

                <p><strong>Before:</strong> You're looking at a photo from March where your shoulders look bigger. Was
                    that after a shoulder day? Were you on a new program? What exercises were you actually doing back
                    then? You have no idea. The photo exists in a vacuum — separated from the training that produced it.
                </p>

                <p><strong>After:</strong> GainFrame connects to Hevy and attaches your workout data to the photo from
                    that day — exercises, sets, reps, total volume. Open any photo and you'll see exactly what you did.
                    Compare two photos and you'll see exactly which program produced the change. Your photos finally
                    have context — and your training finally has proof.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/GF-Promo/single-picture-hevy-integration.PNG"
                        alt="Hevy workout data attached to a progress photo in GainFrame">
                </div>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>5. There was no analysis — just eyeballing it</h2>

                <p><strong>Before:</strong> Your entire comparison process is: stare at two photos. Squint. Tilt your
                    head. Ask your training partner "do I look bigger?" There's no structured feedback, no
                    muscle-by-muscle breakdown, no identification of what specifically improved. It's subjective
                    guesswork.</p>

                <p><strong>After:</strong> Tap "AI Compare" on any two photos and GainFrame breaks down exactly what
                    changed — muscle group by muscle group. "Shoulders: Developing → Strong." "Chest: Needs Work →
                    Developing." You get body fat change, weight delta, FFMI shift, and an overall physique score
                    trajectory. Instead of guessing, you get a detailed progress report that shows you where you
                    improved, where you stalled, and what to focus on next.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>6. You couldn't swipe between photos to spot differences</h2>

                <p><strong>Before:</strong> You're holding your phone, switching back and forth between two photos in
                    your camera roll, trying to spot subtle differences. Or maybe you screenshot both and crop them
                    into a collage app. Either way, it's clunky, slow, and you miss the small changes completely.</p>

                <p><strong>After:</strong> GainFrame's swipe slider lets you drag a dividing line across two aligned
                    photos. Slide left: before. Slide right: after. Changes that are invisible side-by-side become
                    unmissable when you swipe across them — a slightly thicker arm, sharper ab definition, a wider lat
                    spread. It's the moment most people realize they made more progress than they thought.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/before-after/slider.PNG"
                        alt="GainFrame slider comparing before and after photos">
                </div>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>The Real Problem</h2>

                <p>The old way of comparing progress photos wasn't just inconvenient — it was <em>actively hiding your
                        progress from you.</em> Misaligned framing, missing data, zero analysis. You were putting in the
                    work and then using a broken system to judge the results. No wonder so many people quit when they
                    were actually getting somewhere.</p>

                <p>GainFrame fixes all of it. Auto-aligned photos. Weight and body fat overlaid on every image. AI
                    analysis that tells you exactly what changed. A swipe slider that makes even the smallest
                    improvements unmissable.</p>

                <p><strong>Your progress was always there. Now you can actually see it.</strong></p>
