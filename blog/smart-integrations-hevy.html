                <p class="post-lede">A progress photo tells you what your body looks like. But it doesn't tell
                    you <em>why</em> it looks that way. What did you train that day? How much volume did you
                    push? What exercises hit hardest? GainFrame's smart integrations bridge that gap — connecting
                    your photos to the work behind them.</p>

                <p>Two integrations make this possible: <strong>Hevy workout sync</strong> and <strong>Smart
                        Album Sync</strong>. Together, they turn your photo library into a fully contextualized
                    training log.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Hevy integration: workouts attached to photos</h2>

                <p>If you log your workouts in <strong>Hevy</strong>, GainFrame automatically pulls that data
                    and attaches it to the progress photo taken on the same day.</p>

                <p>Open any photo's Deep Dive report and you'll see a workout section showing:</p>

                <div class="post-feature-grid scroll-reveal">
                    <div class="post-feature-card">
                        <div class="post-feature-icon">🏋️</div>
                        <h3>Exercises Performed</h3>
                        <p>Every exercise from your Hevy log for that date — bench press, squats, lateral
                            raises, cable flyes, all of it.</p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="post-feature-icon">📋</div>
                        <h3>Sets & Reps</h3>
                        <p>The exact set-and-rep breakdown for each movement. See your working weights alongside
                            how your physique looked that day.</p>

                        <h3>Total Volume</h3>
                        <p>Aggregate tonnage (weight × reps × sets) for the entire workout. The clearest single
                            metric for training intensity.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="post-feature-card">

                        <h3>Auto Date Matching</h3>
                        <p>No manual tagging. GainFrame matches the photo's date to the Hevy workout logged that
                            same day — automatically.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The power of this combination: when you compare two photos taken months apart, you're not
                    just seeing the visual change — you can see <em>exactly what training produced that
                        change.</em> Did your volume increase? Are you doing more compound movements now? The
                    data is right there next to the photos.</p>

                <blockquote class="post-callout scroll-reveal">
                    <p>Think of it as a training journal that writes itself. Take a gym selfie, log your workout
                        in Hevy, and GainFrame connects the two automatically. Months later, every photo in your
                        timeline has the full context of what you were training.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Smart Album Sync: hands-free photo import</h2>

                <p>Most progress photo apps require you to manually import photos every time you take one.
                    GainFrame's <strong>Smart Album Sync</strong> eliminates that step entirely.</p>

                <p>Here's how it works:</p>

                <ol class="post-steps">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Select a source album.</strong> Pick any album from your Photos library — for
                        example, a "Gym" album you already organize your selfies into.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GainFrame watches it.</strong> Whenever new photos appear in that album,
                        GainFrame automatically imports and processes them — AI classification, scoring, and
                        timeline insertion happen in the background.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Smart filtering.</strong> The sync engine skips screenshots, saved photos from
                        other apps, and non-body images. Only actual gym photos make it through.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Deletion blocklist.</strong> If you delete a photo from GainFrame, the sync
                        engine remembers it and won't re-import it — even if it's still in the source album.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/GF-Promo/album-sync.PNG"
                        alt="GainFrame Smart Album Sync settings showing a connected album with automatic import and background processing">
                </div>

                <p>The result: your GainFrame timeline stays up to date without any manual effort. Add a photo
                    to your gym album, and next time you open GainFrame, it's already classified, scored, and
                    sitting in your timeline.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Why context beats photos alone</h2>

                <p>A photo by itself is a data point. A photo with workout data, body composition metrics, and
                    weight from Apple Health is a <strong>complete snapshot</strong> of that moment in your
                    fitness journey.</p>

                <p>When you compare two of these snapshots — say, January vs. June — you don't just see that
                    your shoulders got wider. You see that your overhead press volume doubled, your body fat
                    dropped 3%, and your weight stayed the same. <em>That's</em> useful information. It tells you
                    what's working and what to keep doing.</p>

                <p>GainFrame is the only progress photo app that makes this connection automatically. Other apps
                    store photos. GainFrame contextualizes them.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Setting it up</h2>

                <p>Both integrations take less than a minute to enable:</p>

                <ol class="post-tips">
                    <li><strong>Hevy:</strong> Open Settings → Integrations → Hevy. Sign in once. GainFrame
                        syncs your workout history and auto-attaches future workouts to matching photos.</li>
                    <li><strong>Album Sync:</strong> Open Settings → Album Sync → Select Album. Choose your gym
                        photo album. New photos import automatically from that point on.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apple Health:</strong> Weight data syncs automatically via HealthKit. No
                        additional setup needed — just allow access when prompted.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Once enabled, everything runs in the background. No daily maintenance, no manual imports, no
                    forgetting to log things. The system works while you train.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Start connecting your data</h2>

                <p>Your progress photos deserve more than a camera roll. Attach your workout data, sync your
                    albums, and let GainFrame build the complete picture of your transformation — automatically.
