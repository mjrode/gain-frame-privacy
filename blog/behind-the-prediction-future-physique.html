                <p class="post-subtitle">It's not a generic filter. It's a personalized roadmap built from your
                    historical progress. Here is a look under the hood at how our AI engine turns your camera roll into
                    actionable data.</p>
            </header>

            <!-- Post Body -->
            <div class="post-body">

                <p class="post-lede">We've all seen the gimmicky photo and face-swap apps. You upload a single selfie,
                    tap a button, and suddenly you look like a shredded comic book hero. It's fun for five seconds, but
                    it's utterly useless for your actual training.</p>

                <p>When we built the <strong>Future Physique</strong> feature for GainFrame, we had one rule: <strong>no
                        generic templates</strong>. If you are going to base your diet and training off a projection,
                    that projection has to be anchored in reality. It has to be built from <em>your</em> data,
                    <em>your</em> frame, and <em>your</em> demonstrated rate of progress.
                </p>

                <p>Here is an inside look at how GainFrame's AI engine actually calculates your trajectory, visualizes
                    your future, and gives you the exact numbers you need to hit your goals.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Step 1: The Analysis Engine (Your History)</h2>

                <p>A single photo only tells the engine what you look like <em>today</em>. To figure out where you are
                    going, the AI needs to know where you have been. This is why GainFrame requires historical data to
                    generate a highly accurate prediction.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/future/loading.PNG"
                        alt="GainFrame loading screen showing the AI predicting your future by reviewing 599 days of progress, analyzing changes, and calculating trajectories">
                </div>

                <p>When you initiate a prediction, the engine doesn't just look at the photo you just took.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It reviews your history:</strong> For example, it might analyze exactly how your body
                        has changed over the last 599 days.</li>
                    <li><strong>It analyzes regional changes:</strong> It isolates your shoulders, chest, arms,
                        midsection, and back to see which muscle groups are responding best to your current training.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>It accounts for your goal:</strong> Are you trying to cut, bulk, or body recomp? The AI
                        adjusts the projection parameters based on your stated objective.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By determining your personalized rate of change across multiple data points, the AI isn't guessing;
                    it's extrapolating a statistically probable outcome.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Step 2: The Visual Projection</h2>

                <p>Once the math is done, the engine renders the visual result. This isn't about slapping 3D abs onto
                    your torso. It is a highly specific rendering of <em>you</em>, further along your current
                    trajectory.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/future/future1.PNG"
                        alt="GainFrame AI Future Physique showing 'You in 6 mo' and indicating key improvements like Deltoid Roundness and Abdominal Visibility">
                </div>

                <p>Look at the specific improvements called out by the engine in the 6-month prediction above:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shoulders:</strong> Significant deltoid roundness and lateral head definition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arms:</strong> Improved bicep peak and visible tricep sweep.</li>
                    <li><strong>Midsection:</strong> Complete abdominal visibility and significantly tighter waist.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These callouts aren't random. They are the exact areas where the AI has observed your fastest
                    historical growth, projected forward.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Step 3: The Hard Numbers</h2>

                <p>Visuals are motivating, but numbers track progress. GainFrame doesn't leave you with just a picture;
                    it gives you the specific metrics you'll achieve if you stay the course.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/future/future2.PNG"
                        alt="GainFrame Projected Stats showing a Goal Body Fat of 10%, Weight of 218 lbs, FFMI of 23.1, and a Trajectory Chart mapping the GainFrame Score over time">
                </div>

                <p>The <strong>Projected Stats</strong> section breaks down your future state into hard targets:
                    reaching elite 10% body fat levels, hitting a body weight of 218 lbs, and pushing your FFMI
                    (Fat-Free Mass Index) to 23.1.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Trajectory Graph</strong> is perhaps the most important tool here. It plots your
                    GainFrame Physique Score over time. The solid line is reality—what you have already achieved. The
                    dashed line is the future. It visually proves that the day-to-day fluctuations in the scale don't
                    matter as long as the <em>trend</em> is moving up and to the right.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Step 4: The Action Plan</h2>

                <p>Knowing what you <em>could</em> look like is only half the battle. You need to know exactly what to
                    do when you walk into the gym tomorrow to make it reality.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/future/future3.PNG"
                        alt="GainFrame Recommended Focus screen showing specific actionable steps like Lean Bulk Transition, Upper Pectoral Focus, and Posterior Chain Definition">
                </div>

                <p>This is where GainFrame bridges the gap between tracking and coaching. Based on your weakest muscle
                    groups and furthest goals, the AI provides a <strong>Recommended Focus</strong> plan.</p>
                <p>If your upper chest is lagging behind your lateral delts, you won't get generic advice like "work out
                    harder." You will get targeted, actionable directives: <em>"Upper Pectoral Focus: Start chest days
                        with 3 sets of incline dumbbell press."</em> Need more hamstring sweep? <em>"Posterior Chain
                        Definition: Add 3 sets of Romanian deadlifts weekly."</em></p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Step 5: Accountability</h2>

                <p>Finally, we built the ability to export and share your prediction. When you vocalize a goal and show
                    people exactly what you are aiming for, you mentally commit to it.</p>

                <div class="post-feature-grid scroll-reveal">
                    <div class="post-feature-card"
                        style="grid-column: 1 / -1; display:flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start; background: transparent; padding: 0;">
                        <img src="../assets/future/export.JPG"

                        <div style="flex:1;">
                            <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Export Options</h3>
                            <p>GainFrame allows you to export your prediction in a clean, shareable card. You can toggle
                                specific export options—Stats, Narrative, and Score—depending on what you want to share
                                with your coach, your training partner, or your social feed.</p>
                            <p>By putting the "You in 6 months" picture on your lock screen, you eliminate the friction
                                between your current actions and your future goals. Every time you open your phone, you
                                know exactly what you are working towards.</p>
                        </div>

                </div>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Stop Guessing. Start Predicting.</h2>

                <p>You are already putting in the hours. You are already eating the meals. Don't leave your results up
                    to guesswork. Use a tool that turns your hard work into predictable, measurable outcomes.</p>
