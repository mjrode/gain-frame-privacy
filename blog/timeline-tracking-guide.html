            <!-- Post Body -->
            <div class="post-body">

                <p class="post-lede">You've been taking progress photos for months. Maybe you scroll back through
                    your camera roll occasionally, squinting at thumbnails, trying to spot the difference between
                    February and August. It's hard to see change when you're looking at photos one at a time.
                    That's what the Timeline solves.</p>

                <p>GainFrame's <strong>Timeline</strong> organizes every imported photo into a chronological,
                    pose-filtered view with three zoom levels — Day, Month, and Quarter. Each entry shows the
                    date, your AI physique score, and estimated body fat. You can see your entire transformation
                    at a glance, or zoom into a specific day to compare individual shots.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Three views, one timeline</h2>

                <p>The Timeline isn't a single flat list. It's three distinct zoom levels, each designed for a
                    different purpose:</p>

                <div class="post-feature-grid scroll-reveal">
                    <div class="post-feature-card">
                        <div class="post-feature-icon">📅</div>
                        <h3>Day View</h3>
                        <p>Every individual photo, one per row. See exactly what you looked like on a specific
                            date with the AI score and body fat percentage right next to it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="post-feature-card">
                        <div class="post-feature-icon">📆</div>
                        <h3>Month View</h3>
                        <p>Monthly snapshots that condense your progress into a digestible overview. Great for
                            spotting trends without drowning in individual entries.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="post-feature-card">
                        <div class="post-feature-icon">📊</div>
                        <h3>Quarter View</h3>
                        <p>The widest lens. See 3-month blocks side by side — perfect for tracking slow
                            transformations that only become visible over longer windows.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The key insight: <strong>subtle changes that are invisible day-to-day become obvious at the
                        quarterly level.</strong> You might not notice your shoulders widening over two weeks,
                    but three months of photos side by side makes it unmistakable.</p>

                <h2>How the Timeline gets built</h2>

                <p>You don't have to manually organize anything. The Timeline builds itself from your imported
                    photos:</p>

                <ol class="post-steps">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Import your photos.</strong> Select gym selfies from your camera roll — a few or
                        a few thousand. GainFrame's batch import handles them all in the background.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>AI classifies by pose.</strong> Each photo is automatically tagged as Front,
                        Back, Side, Front Flexed, or your custom templates. The Timeline filters by pose, so
                        you're always comparing like-to-like.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Chronological sorting.</strong> Photos are ordered by the date they were taken
                        (from EXIF data), not when you imported them. Import photos from last year and they slot
                        into the right place automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>AI scores every entry.</strong> Each timeline entry shows your GainFrame Physique
                        Score and estimated body fat percentage — so you can see the numbers changing alongside
                        the visuals.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>The result: a ready-made transformation timeline that might go back months or years,
                    depending on how many gym photos are in your camera roll.</p>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Timeline videos: your transformation in motion</h2>

                <p>Static photos show you snapshots. But a <strong>timeline video</strong> shows the full arc of
                    your transformation as a smooth, morphing sequence — cycling through your progress photos in
                    chronological order.</p>

                <div class="post-hero-image scroll-reveal">
                    <img src="../assets/GF-Promo/time-line-video.PNG"
                        alt="GainFrame timeline video generation screen showing a transformation video being created from progress photos">
                </div>

                <p>GainFrame generates these videos automatically from your timeline. Select a pose, choose a
                    date range, and the app stitches your photos into a looping video with smooth transitions
                    between frames. The visual effect is striking — you can <em>watch</em> your shoulders widen,
                    your midsection tighten, and your overall physique evolve frame by frame.</p>

                <blockquote class="post-callout scroll-reveal">
                    <p>Timeline videos are the single most shareable piece of content GainFrame produces. A 10-second
                        clip of your 6-month transformation is more compelling than any individual comparison photo.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>These videos are perfect for sharing on Instagram Stories, TikTok, or sending to your
                    training partner. They're exported at high resolution with the GainFrame watermark, so people
                    know where it came from.</p>

                <h2>Getting the most out of your Timeline</h2>

                <p>A few habits that make your Timeline dramatically more useful:</p>

                <ol class="post-tips">
                    <li><strong>Import everything.</strong> Don't cherry-pick. Import all your gym photos — even
                        the bad ones. The AI filters out non-body photos automatically, and more data points
                        means a richer timeline.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stick to 2–3 poses.</strong> Front relaxed and back relaxed cover the most
                        ground. The Timeline is filtered by pose, so consistency here directly translates to a
                        cleaner visual story.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the Quarter view for motivation.</strong> When daily weigh-ins and weekly
                        comparisons feel discouraging, zoom out to quarters. The long-term trend is almost always
                        more positive than you think.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generate a video every few months.</strong> Set a reminder. The transformation
                        video gets more impressive with every batch of new photos you add.</li>
                </ol>

                <hr class="post-divider">

                <h2>Start your timeline</h2>

                <p>Import your gym photos. Let the AI organize and score them. Then switch to Timeline view and
                    see your transformation unfold — day by day, month by month, quarter by quarter.</p>

                <p>Your progress is already in your camera roll. The Timeline just makes it visible.</p>
